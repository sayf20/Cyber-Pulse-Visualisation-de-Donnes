## Project Description

This project visualizes cyber attack data on a world map, showing attack origins, destinations, types, and frequencies. The interactive dashboard provides multiple visualization methods including a real-time attack map, time series data, and various charts to analyze attack patterns.

## Data Source

The data used in this project represents cyber attack information including:

- Attack source (country)
- Attack destination (country)
- Attack type (DDoS, Phishing, Malware, etc.)
- Timestamp
- Attack protocol
- Port information
- Attack intensity

The dataset covers the period from January 1, 2024, to the present day. In a production environment, this data would be sourced from real network monitoring systems, but for demonstration purposes, we've implemented realistic mock data generation.

## Technologies Used

This project is built exclusively with:

- D3.js for all data visualizations
- TypeScript for type safety
- React for the component architecture
- TailwindCSS for styling

## Getting Started
